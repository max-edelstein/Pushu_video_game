# Pushu_video_game

To play this game requires the BGB gameboy emulator. Link is http://bgb.bircd.org/

Posted in this directory is my very small video game "Pushu". Soon many examples of my source code will be posted on my github.
Expect them here soon. The game was made using the game boy development kit and the c programming language.
Soon I plan to post a guide on using the Harry Mulders game boy tile designer (GBTD) and game boy map builder (GBMB).
Lastly, note many of my examples are coming from previous versions of my game that I worked on. Any examples that I post but did not create will have the original creators citation and contact info inside the .c file. Sadly much of the contact info may not even be around anymore due to various examples being from the early 2000's and websites such as yahoo's Geocities.

Game Directions = S key to use Pushu tape attack. Arrow keys are to move your character. Two arrow keys can be downpressed at once to move diagonally. It is suggested to set the s key to the shift key instead. This can be done by going into BGB emulator settings and remapping the key for the a button.

Objective = Hit the puzzle pieces in a way that makes sense with your players movement.
