# Pushu_video_game
Posted in this directory is my very small video game "Pushu". Soon many examples of my source code will be posted on my github.
Expect them here later today. The game was made using the game boy development kit and the c programming language.
Soon I plan to post a guide on using the Harry Mulders game boy tile designer and game boy map builder.
